    "Very nice property.",
    "Wonderful place to camp. Nice large space with firepit.",
    "The atmosphere is welcoming. Charlie the dog is a dote .",
    "This camp site is right outside of Groveland with easy access to Yosemite, Hetch Hetchy, Carlon Falls and so much more. It’s a good base camp while exploring the area. Enjoyed the outdoor shower, clean port-a-potty and star gazing. Careful with the mosquitoes tho they will getcha.",
    "Great spot next to Yosemite entrance",
    "The campground is amazing. Easy to navigate and each site comes with a picnic table and plenty of space for a few tents. We got creekside 1 and loved hanging out in the creek and listening to the frogs. I found some legit gold panning in the creek. The hostess Pamela was so kind to us and gave us a really nice tour of the property. We were here in Mid-April and the lupin was in full bloom, turkeys frequent the creek, and the two dogs kept us safe and were very friendly. I definitely recommend to anyone visiting Yosemite. Totally worth it.",
    "Definitely a HIP camp. Very close to top of Old Priest Grade. Rural and Pamela is still workiing on more sites. Really in the woods and sites are spread out. Wish we brought our pup but couldn't this trip.",
    "What a great oasis. Pamela is a fantastic host and has set up quite the campground. Very well maintained with great amenities. We had a ton of fun and met some great people. Everyone chipped in and took really good care of the property. Highly recommended!!",
    "We went the weekend after the Labor Day weekend so we had the whole place by ourselves. My kids spent time in the little pools of the dry creek looking for tadpoles and just exploring and collecting pretty crystal rocks. Pamela was a wonderful host and we’ll definitely be going again. Our site had some shade most of the time and she had nice firepits for us to roast marshmallows. She also let our kids pick some strawberries in her pretty garden. Thank you Pamela for the great weekend trip!",
    "Pamela has put in a lot of work building this campground. There are about 10 sites with picnic tables, two communal fire pits, a porta potty and two solar showers, which were amazing to use after a long day of hiking! She has two dogs on the property which were super sweet. The creek was kind of dried up but would be amazing in the spring. We felt super safe and comfortable here, would def stay here again and recommend to others. It was only 10 mins or so to nearby town Groveland to get groceries, restaurants, etc.",
    "I came here with a couple of my friends, and we all loved this campsite! Lots of space, clean and working amenities, and of course, an amazing host. Campsites are staggered up a hill, so you’re not right against another group. Additionally, the dogs are friendly and adorable. We only stayed for a night, but I will definitely recommend this place to any friends who visit the area. Thank you for having us!",
    "Pamela is such a gracious and kind hostess.. the land is beautiful and wild. We had plenty of room to set up camp and the showers were life savers! So happy we had our trusty guard dogs too. With only a 30 minute drive to the Yosemite entrance, this is about as good as it gets! Also, Groveland is a great spot for pizza and beer! Definitely would stay here again’",
    "We enjoyed our stay here. Pam was very hospitable and her dogs were cute!",
    "we really enjoyed our stay! pamela was very nice & accommodating & the campsites were spacious and decently far apart. her dogs are also every lovable & friendly. i would love to stay here again!",
    "Had a good time at the campsite with my bros! Plenty of room for the six of us to kickback and relax. Pam was great and the portable toilet and showers were nice and clean. (I’m kinda particular about that, lol) I highly recommend it.PS. the two dogs are awesome. (DO NOT FEED, hahaha)",
    "Pamela has done a fantastic job with the property. The camping spot was perfect and the complimentary community campfire is an excellent touch. Will definitely return",
    "I would like to say thank you to our awesome and very nice Host Pamela. Our groups stay was amazing and relaxing. Everything went as smoothly as possible.this was our first camping experience with our group and this made us a re turning memebers. First time Hipcamp user and this stay made us a fan of this site and campsite. We had a group of 6 and all give rave review to our host and campsite. Each site had its own picnic table and camp security ( sweet lovable and super friendly guard dogs) it is not a hard place to find and oncd you find you would like to just stay there and enjoy the fresh air. At night we all enjoyed the fire pit and the beautiful night sky. We felt safe and comfortable there. We will definitely be back again.",
    "Beautiful Redwoods on the property and a surprisingly luxurious tiny house with all the amenities! The interiors are beautiful and the attention to detail make this experience one of the best Hipcamp we ever stayed at! The outdoor hot shower was a nice addition. We fell in love with the property and Marcy and Sam were so sweet! We would definitely be back here, the place is MAGICAL!",
    "Our stay at Sam And Marcy's Tiny Tim was amazing! Both I and my girlfriend who stayed with me at Tiny Tim travel alot and our stay at the tiny house, Tiny Tim, was easily the most magical stay we have ever had. The tiny house is not only very cool, but it is very cozy! While there, we sat by the camp fire and were able to see all the stars. The property itself is something straight out of a fairytale! Between the tiny house, the redwoods, the outdoor fireplace, the stars, and being a 5 minute drive to the ocean, the location couldn't be any better. Not to mention, both Sam and Marcy are very friendly. If you need local recommendations, they are happy to provide them! Both I and my girlfriend agree, when we come back to Mendocino, we are going to stay at Tiny Tim. I/we miss the place already.Seriously, stay here, it is sooooooo worth it!",
    "Lots of great pros : there wasn’t anyone else there and doesn’t seem set up to be that way. So it was nice to not have to share or feel like we had to be concerned with other campers. Shower was great. The bathroom nice. Lots of cute views and wildlife and farm animals. Felt safe on the property with the gate. Only wish the site had maybe a marker to let us know that’s where the tent area was but maybe that’s the beauty of it is you can sorta choose at the site. Rebecca was quick in her responses which is also great. Feel like if we had needed her we would have been able to get ahold quickly. Also super close to town but you don’t feel like ur in it.",
    "Amazing stay on the farm! Rebecca has everything you could want in a campsite and the location is unbeatable.",
    "Rebecca's spot was such a great place to get out of the city and enjoy nature. Our spot was perfect - there was plenty of room for our car/tent set up, and able to place our camping chairs and kitchen set up right next to our tent. There was a nice kitchen/cooking area set up and available for those that need it which I found to be a very thoughtful option.The views were amazing, especially at night. This is a great place to stargaze! The bathroom was clean and comfortable and my group really enjoyed the homemade soap and facial bar samples Rebecca offered and we even purchased a few goodies. Rebecca was a sweetheart! She was responsive and made herself available and great person to chat with. We 100% recommend this spot for those who want to unplug for a bit and enjoy the sounds of nature.",
    "We weren’t actually able to stay, but we really appreciated Rebecca’s responsiveness and flexibility. We hope we can stay another time!",
    "I arrived shortly after the gas station closed, but thanks to the signage and map that they left out, I had no issue finding my camp site! I was at tent site 6, which was a very short walk away from the gas station. The site itself was surprisingly very comfortable, and the wood chips were a nice touch as they kept the dirt that I tracked inside my tent to a minimum.",
    "Absolutely loved camping here. We had site 3 which was along the creek, so beautiful. Easy to find, nice to have a small store and ice cream on site! The restroom near us was a Porto, there was a trailer with a sink and flushing toilets over by the RV sites. If you come in July, the site would be full of wild blackberries, they had a ton of unripe fruits in late June. The wifi was very slow, which is totally fine but I wouldn't count on it for working or streaming. Highly reccomended and we will be back! Firepit had a grate for cooking and grilling.",
    "We had such an awesome time tent camping at Kings Canyon RV Resort! Great proximity to both Sequoia and Kings Canyon. We stayed in site 8 which we absolutely loved. Both site 8 and 9 were great if you are looking for something a little bit more secluded. Beautiful drive into the camp grounds. Definitely save directions on your phone before leaving!! There is a little area where they sell firewood and ice cream, but they weren’t open very late in the evening which was inconvenient when we needed fire wood. Over all great trip!",
    "Simple campsite that did the job well. Portable bathrooms were clean and garbage receptacles were close by. All of the sites seemed freshly redone. Great deal on huge bundles of high quality firewood",
    "Stayed 1 night in June on campsite 3, right next to the babbling brook. 20miles away from the Roads End permit station. Unique campsite within Kings Canyon National Park. First camp with a double gravity gas pump i’ve ever stayed at. Friendly staff. Ice cream and beer available for sale from 9a-7p. Nice to have this spot for before and after backpacking in the back country",
    "perfect location between kings canyon and the upper portion of sequoia np",
    "Great spot with access to Kings Canyon National Park. Would definitely stay again!",
    "Great location for reaching both parks. Convenient shop sells some snacks, firewood, and ice. All the reviews noting the lack of shade are accurate, especially at site 1 (forest fire took out all the shade trees). Not much noise from cars at night driving on the roadway. Gets super windy at night so make sure to tie down tents and flaps securely",
    "Beautiful camp experience! Loved every second.",
    "This camp was by far our favorite hip camp we’ve stayed at. The location couldn’t have been better. Nestled right between kings canyon and the sequoias, the view was perfect and it was so easy to get to both parks. There was potable water and the host was very kind and helpful!",
    "Great site!! Perfect location between the two areas of the park. Mike was great, very helpful. Nice restrooms, no showers but they do have a hose at each site that you can use. Ice cream was great too, and they have wifi for purchase $4! Beautiful area and road is very quite at night. Would highly recommend.",
    "This was one of our favorite campsites during a weeklong road trip to four national parks! Site #3 was ideal: quiet, flat, and next to a lovely stream. We visited during the shoulder season and had the grounds almost entirely to ourselves. But even during peak season, I imagine it would be far less congested than most camgrounds. The facilities were clean, the location was beautiful and centrally located between park attractions, and the host was great to work with.",
    "I had a wonderful stay at Hip Camp. The gentleman at check-in was helpful and friendly, and my camp site was clean and close to the river. It was the perfect place to rest after a long day of exploring Sequoia. We will definitely be back!",
    "Great hosts, clean site, super convenient location. Had a great weekend!",
    "Great accommodations in a beautiful setting. The campsite was clean, quiet, and we met some really great people. Great location to explore both Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks. Hosts were present, accommodating, and very sweet, offering tips on the area and checking in with guests. Having their ice cream on a hot day is also a plus! Highly recommend this site!",
    "The hosts were very kind and friendly. The tent sites had fresh wood chips on the ground which really cut down on dirt. We had to leave early due to illness and a pending thunderstorm, but we would stay there again. It gets pretty warm there so bring shade; the forest and Sequoias are a few miles up the road.",
    "Great spot right in Kings Canyon!! This location although right off the highway was beautiful, private, and very convenient because we arrived late. Water was available at site which was very nice. Stayed at site #4.",
    "Amazing to find a last minute site as all the park campsites were full. Great family run operation and close to the beautiful Kings river.",
    "While I can't speak for the actual tent sites, which were being worked on during my stay, I can only review the rv/camper sites area where I had to set up my tent. The ground was perfectly level, which was great since most tent sites are on a bit of an incline, however it was covered with wood chips (at least at my site) which did make it a bit uncomfortable, but again, this spot was designed for a camper. There wasn't much shade at all, which proved to be a challenge for me since it was extremely hot (I heard the tent site area across the road was pretty much the same, in the fact that there wasn't any shade), so much so that I had to pull up stakes and retreat from the heat. I wish I could've stayed longer because the canyon is breathtakingly beautiful and I would've loved to explore and hike more of it. The camp is in an ideal location, within a short(ish) drive in either direction to the sights of the canyon and the interior of the National Park (I believe the camp is in the National Forest, not the actual park). Oh, and let me not forget to mention the absolute best part of this place, which is that it is conveniently situated at an ice cream stand! And the ice cream is fantastic! They also sell ice, icy cold drinks (including beer and canned cocktails for those old enough to drink), have gas available to purchase from the old time pumps, and wifi is available (for a nominal fee). It is indeed a cool spot (well, at least cool in the sense of hip cause it sure was hot in the sense of temperature!) I will be sure to camp here again should I (and hopefully I will) find myself in that amazing park again.",
    "We had a great time tent camping here! Some spots are better than other (I suppose this is expected).. It was full over the weekend when we arrived but during the week most sites were empty which made our stay even more relaxing. The ice-cream was delicious! Will be back, thank you.",
    "100% recommend staying at this site! The folks were genuinely kind and even changed our reservation to the shadiest campsite upon arrival. The facilities were great. The sites were spacious and well-maintained. If you’re considering booking a trip here, just do it already!",
    "The pros: (1) super convenient location within Kings Canyon (30min drive to Mist Falls Trailhead and right across the road from 24/7 public restroom and ice cream shop); (2) private individual campsite; (3) some nice amenities (picnic table, trashcan, camp fire ring)The cons: (1) the ground is covered with soft wood chips which is hard to stake in your tent (which made the tent flap noisily as it was windy at night), rather hard to maneuver/park a motorcycle on (if that is your vehicle), and gets everywhere (in the tent, shoes, etc) - this to us was the biggest con; (2) lots of bugs/mosquitos (though I think that may just be a general Kings Canyon feature - bring bugs spray!); (3) the side road getting into the (lower elevation) campsites is a bit on the steep side and not very confidence-inspiring getting out of.Overall a solid campsite except for the wood chips; if they change the surface to dirt or other more stake-able material, then it would be a solid 5/5 campsite in my opinion.",
    "Great site right on King’s Canyon Scenic Byway. Great spot for viewing stars or to use as a base camp while exploring Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks. Well maintained site with bathrooms.",
    "Great host, very helpful, lots of water and good camp spots, and they even sell ice cream if you want it!",
    "The owner was super helpful and had some great recommendations for the area.",
    "I would absolutely stay here again. We went during the hottest days I've ever experienced in California, and our tent site was pleasant in the early morning and evening. We definitely needed to head for the caves or the hills during the heat of the day. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to stay here.",
    "It was a nice area in between both parks. And the campsites were far apart from each other for privacy. Ice, wood, and gasoline were sold there too and drinks.",
    "We came in very late and found a very nice note explaining where our campsite was. Could not have imagined a more idyllic campsite location, would highly recommend.",
    "Great place to stay! Camp sites were well maintained, and we appreciated the super easy access to clean drinking water. Not too much shade, so bring your own sun shader. It was in the high 90s in mid June. Definitely get yourself an ice cream!! Thanks, Mike!",
    "It was wonderful staying here! Beautiful views of the mountains and stars at night.",
    "Spacious campsite and a very laid back host. Mike was very accommodating. We booked tent site 7, but Mike offered other campsite options for us to choose from since our site was very close to the road. Firewood, beverages, ice cream, coffee, and wifi for sale on this campground. The wind picks up in the evening. I was just a little bummed that there were no trees at our site to set up a hammock.",
    "Great experience! Beautiful scenery and great location for exploring local features. Campsite was 20 feet from creek that feds into Kings river a mile or two downstream.",
    "Perfect place right in the heart of the valley! Woke up to beautiful views of the canyon walls. 5/5 stars! I would definitely recommend staying here.",
    "Very nice camping site overall with a gorgeous night sky view. You can buy firewood, ice-cream and chilled beer at the camp site till 7PM. A few things to know before camping here that will help - 1) There is no tree shade on some sites to it gets really hot really quickly in the morning. 2) There is no grill on the fire pit.",
    "This is such a great hidden gem in Kings Canyon NP! It is on the main road (180) maybe ~30 min from the major trailheads. The campground is next to a small gas station/ice cream stand and run by the same folks. When we arrived we checked in at the stand and they directed us to our campsite. They also sell ice and firewood which was super convenient. There was some miscommunication about us having a second car (I couldn’t figure out how to adjust my reservation on hipcamp) but they were super accommodating and we were able to pay for the extra vehicle easily (they take cards FYI). The listing is accurate as we had a fire ring, picnic table, potable water and flushing toilets. I absolutely would recommend this place and plan to come back!",
    "Nice camping site to explore both parks (especially if all NPS campsites are full). Flush toilets, ice, and firewood on site",
    "First time ever Hipcamping!My experience camping at this location was awesome. Our 4 days there felt like we were camping within a communit! Everyone was so friendly and welcoming.Mike, our host made many efforts to improve our stay by always checking in to see if we needed anything.We well be back!!!Items for sale at camp - ice, wood, beer and ice cream!! Oh, and gas.",
    "Will come back!",
    "Nice area, convenient base for day trips to Kings Canyon and Sequoia. Host has drinking water water taps set up thoughout camp. Ok amount of space between sites. Open high desert setting can get hot but if you are out most of the day the evenings were beautiful there.",
    "I would highly recommend this campsite. The sites are great, they have ample room, nice flat ground, benches, potable water, fire pits. Not to mention the amazing views from the property. The campsite is perfectly located to explore any part of Kings Canyon with all the best spots no more than 25 mins away. Mike was really great, he was very welcoming and easy to communicate with before arrival. He even has beer and ice-cream on sale on the property if you want a little treat. I definitely plan on staying here again when we return to Kings Canyon",
    "Host was very relaxed and helpful! Great easy campsite inside the park.",
    "Perfect spot. Was so thankful to be able to stay there . From there you could immediately start the park visits the next morning.",
    "Such an awesome + beautiful place to stay! The campsites were private and the management was awesome. Thanks for a great stay!",
    "Beautiful, clean, friendly host, great location. Can't wait to come back!",
    "Mike the manager is a salt of the earth kind of person and Im so glad I stayed there because I truly appreciate supporting hard-working folks like him so that folks like us can enjoy the outdoors with little ammenities. He gave me a choice site to pitch a tent. People were quiet and respectful. Great for birding, star-watching, and ideal location near Kings Canyon and Sequoia NP's. Mike is overwhelmed serving ice cream all day but is obviously trying single-handedly to continue improving the place. I highly recommend. Even if you dont camp, swing by for ice cream and check out the old school gas pump. Support this place!",
    "Great, peaceful spot right in Kings Canyon for tents and RVs! Beautiful star gazing, and potable water at each site. You can’t beat it. The host, Mike, also make himself available and is very friendly and helpful. They also have gas, firewood, ice, etc, available on site. If you’re planning on staying near your campsite during the day it can get hot, but we hiked Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, which are both within driving distance of Kings Canyon RV resort, and mostly spent nights and evenings at the campsite. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend.",
    "We had a great time staying in King's Canyon! Our host was very kind and laidback. The campsite was private and we'll maintained, plus the view from our site was beautiful! Being able to purchase gas on site was very convenient.",
    "Site #4 was great and the most secluded, as others have mentioned. We were welcomed by a herd of cows, that walked past our camp a few times in the evening. I had my dog with me, so next time I will probably book a different site, in one of the meadows, that has a little more room to set up a long leash dog run.",
    "Beautiful spot to camp. The creek, the forest and the birds were spectacular. Lots of diversity. Portapotty was very clean.",
    "This was our first Hipcamp experience and it did not disappoint. The property is gorgeous, camp sites are large, and spaced out so you have privacy. We had a great time",
    "The site was so lovely!! Very green and peaceful and well taken care of. 10/10 will go back asap!!!",
    "Daniel’s land was perfect and intimate for an easy camping trip. As a host, he was very communicative and flexible. The grounds were well taken care of and there was privacy. We will definitely be coming back!",
    "Flat camp site, quiet location, convenient porta-potty with hand washing station. Nice fire pit.",
    "What a fantastic spot! First trip camping with my boys and it was awesome. Gorgeous area, ideal campsite setup, spotless toilets (seriously!) and Daniel was friendly and responsive",
    "Beautiful open space with room to explore.",
    "Camping was great! Site was very clean and private, purchasing firewood & having it at the campsite when we arrived was nice. Definitely go back!",
    "Fabulous camping experience! Daniel's property is beautiful: a gorgeous meadow surrounded by trees, all kinds of birds, the occasional neighboring cow, all with the perfect firepit. We stayed in Site 4 and, as others have mentioned, of the seven sites currently available, 4 is the most private (no line of sight to anyone else). Site 4 receives quite a bit of sun so we were glad we brought our sun shade for some additional coverage for when we were hanging at camp in the middle of the day. We'll definitely be back, maybe this time with a group and rent out a few sites (1-3 or 5-7) to combine. Daniel and his kids stopped by to say hello and they were all super nice. Looking forward to our next stay!",
    "Awesome camping. The spots are large. Great and friendly host. We woke up to birds chirping every morning. Super peaceful.",
    "Beautiful land, Daniel was very accommodating, our sites had a ton of space, bathrooms very clean, great tent spots in the shade, really amazing experience, will definitely be back!",
    "The open fields are great for playing games or kicking a ball.",
    "The site was so beautiful and serene, and comfortably fit our group of 5 and our 2 dogs! Daniel and his family came by to greet us and made sure we had a comfortable stay. The site was clean and cozy, portable toilets tidy and it made it easy to pack in and pack out everything. We are already planning to come back!!",
    "Fantastic place to stay we so enjoyed ourselves. Beautiful, quiet, and peaceful. Great setting and Daniel was a fabulous host. We will go back again. Would recommend to anyone. We travel with a 16 Airstream BaseCamp.",
    "We had a great time. Host daniel showed my kids some secret spots which they enjoyed.",
    "Wonderful host. Super attentive to many planning questions for a large group with kids. Beautiful campground. Will definitely return!",
    "What an amazing spot! Daniel and his family have made 7 wonderful campsites. Plenty of room to spread out. A large grass field to play games in. Camp spots are perfectly placed underneath shade trees and protected from the wind.",
    "Quiet and secluded campsite. We really enjoyed being able to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It was pretty easy to get to (no crazy scary winding mountain roads), and spacing between campsites made for a good privacy. Port-o-potties and wash station were well maintained. Loved that we were able to purchase local firewood that was at our site when we arrived. Our kiddos enjoyed being able to run around the big meadow and just being in nature. Being able to stop at Bodega Bay on the way home was a nice plus.",
    "Nice little secluded campsite very close to the coast and bodega bay. Host was friendly and helpful. Easy to find, port a potties were pretty clean.",
    "Great spot. Plenty of space. Clean bathroom. Seemed very far away though only 1 hr from east bay. Great bird and frog noises at night. Friendly and available host. Was great for first time camping with 2 little kids.",
    "Beautiful location tucked away off the beaten path. We enjoyed the peace and quiet in the last spot of the second meadow. The night sounds were fantastic with loads of frogs and owls serenading us. Not too far to some of the most beautiful beaches on the Sonoma coast.",
    "Quiet and just off the grid enough to feel secluded. Sites 4-6 are spaced out enough for some privacy. Picnic bench and fire pit grill grate are a huge plus. Would come back for sure!",
    "Great place. Super friendly",
    "Very nice secluded spot for RV’s. Pro tip, rent out spots 1, 2 and 3 with your friends for a private space. Waking up to the cows grazing was also an amazing experience.",
    "Camping at Finley Camp was such a breath of fresh air! We stayed at Site #7, which seemed to have the more shade during the afternoon. There was so much space, such a change from state campgrounds. Daniel was very accommodating and very kind, checking in to see how we were doing on both days. It was a perfect weekend and we hope to come back with more friends next time.",
    "Well maintained. Easy to find. Great location. Would go back again.",
    "This is one of the nicest Hipcamp s that I’ve stayed at. Super cozy campsites with plenty of space. Clean and well tended. I would definitely stay here again.",
    "I stayed at site 7 with my camper van. It was a great very isolated spot from the other sites. Very quiet, lovely tree cover, and generally lush foliage. Would be great for someone with dogs especially.",
    "Great tent camping with our small dog. Will definitely be back!",
    "This is a beautiful, peaceful camp side nestled between a forest and a creek. Highly recommend",
    "Daniel was a helpful and attentive host. The site was very well maintained and we appreciated the drop off of dry firewood!",
    "We had a great time at Finley Camp. The camp site we spacious and private enough to feel like we had our own little slice of this beautiful scenic property. Daniel was a great host and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Would highly recommend",
    "It was quiet and serene. Daniel was very nice and helpful. We stayed at campsite 6 and had a really great time. Will definitely be back.",
    "Lovely, quiet area next to a small creek - we listened to the frogs sing all night. The porta pottys were clean, close by and had a hand washing station. The host was quick to respond to questions and very attentive.",
    "Pristine site and friendly welcome from Daniel. Watch out for cow patties and you'll have a great time!",
    "Beautiful property. Clean! Well spaced out with neighbors. Super dreamy camping weekend. We will absolutely be back again",
    "Beautiful property and a nice host. Excellent communication as well. I would gladly return.",
    "Sound of the babbling brook and nighttime frogs was great. Cow paddies added an element of adventure!",
    "We spent 3 weeks at this campground in 2009.Enjoyed every minute of it",
    "If all camping grounds were like this one I would go more often.",
    "Lots of great pros : there wasn’t anyone else there and doesn’t seem set up to be that way. So it was nice to not have to share or feel like we had to be concerned with other campers. Shower was great. The bathroom nice. Lots of cute views and wildlife and farm animals. Felt safe on the property with the gate. Only wish the site had maybe a marker to let us know that’s where the tent area was but maybe that’s the beauty of it is you can sorta choose at the site. Rebecca was quick in her responses which is also great. Feel like if we had needed her we would have been able to get ahold quickly. Also super close to town but you don’t feel like ur in it",
    "Amazing stay ! They have everything you could want in a campsite and the location is unbeatable",
    "I absolutely loved this camp spot. I was able to sleep under the stars and enjoy the beautiful views on the morning. I was able to pack light and have everything I needed. I will be back. One of my favorite spots.",
    "This is such a great site and so peaceful!! I was traveling by myself and felt so safe and welcomed",
    "Really lovely property. You get to enjoy some city life near by and beaches and for the evening / morning, enjoy camping in nature. Really unique and enjoyable placr.",
    "The property was gorgeous as well. You can sit and watch the sunset, have a nice fire, keep your food cold in the cooler provided and so much more!",
    "Fire pit area was great! Super accommodating to our change of plans. Definitely would recommend for a one night stay",
    "We had an amazing time. They set up everything and the location was beyond beautiful.",
    "For my kids first time camping, this was perfect and they had the best time. 10 out of 10 would recommend and go again.",
    "Great spot! Sunset was beautiful. Campsite was close to the house but still felt private.",
    "Loved it very nice set up. To bad we arrived later then we wanted to but we enjoyed our stay!",
    "We had a great time staying here! The host was so welcoming, and who doesn’t love pumpkin and the chickens! A great area to camp, and incredible sounds and views at all times of day. Will be back!",
    "Easy to find campsite with lots of amenities! Would stay again!",
    "Great place to hang out. Wonderful property. Crazy that it’s natural rock formation naturally designed the site. Don’t miss the opportunity to hangout here.",
    "This is probably the coolest campsite I’ve ever stayed at",
    "The space is insanely cool and has everything you’d want for camping (outdoor sink, grill, cooler, fire). ",
    "Hosts are awesome and gave us a ton of local recommendations. I can’t say enough good things about the experience here — highly recommend and can’t wait to come back!",

    "Great way to get away from the hustle and have a nice camping experience.",
    "The boulder campfire area was fantastic and very calm and cozy. Will go back again!",
    "The camping experience was great. Lovely set up in the back, fireplace, picnic table, sink, toilet, few lights. A very well equipped campground.",
    "We absolutely loved camping here! We expected a basic sort of site, and it was so much more! The views, the beautiful solar lights softly illumining everything, the massive boulders giving a sheltered space for a campfire, a yeti cooler to keep our food in, and the mattresses and bedding were the real deal!",
    " I crashed for 1 night and it was the perfect weekend getaway to reset and recharge. ",
    "It was very nice to stay here.Host is very kind and responded quickly to our needs. I definitely visit again. Thanks.",
    "This site is amazing! We had a really great time and planning to come back with friends!",
    "The location was perfect! Isolated by beautiful rock formations, but easily accessible.",
    "The space is awesome and the host was super nice. Amazing spot with many things provided like campfire, small grill, cooler, sink, lit bench, and bathroom/shower. Also had good reception there. Would totally come back.",
    "The site was really beautiful and the host is very accommodating. This place felt like glamping in tents!",
    "Really beautifully set up site. Hosts were great and they provided nice extras",
    "This place is awesome. It’s not too big, but enough for 2-4people. nice get away for a short trip.",
    "The hosts were very kind and nice. I’d definitely come back.",
    "Perfect lil getaway! We enjoyed our campsite, cozy and loved the lights at night.",

    "I was not satisfied with this campsite, the map was deceiving and we were not aware that we would be directly next to a highway (not even any trees dividing it from our campsite - just some grass) with cars constantly zooming by and being awoken by headlights. That was extremely unpleasant as we were looking for a peaceful getaway. There are also no grates for cooking over the campfire so be aware of that as well. Additionally, there were never any employees around to assist us to maybe find another campsite and help us navigate the site , we weren’t even aware that there was a flushable toilet until the morning we were leaving the site.",
    "Sites not maintained .Fire pits filled with water as no drainage holes .Toilets need to be properly cleaned .Nice area but attention needs to be made to sites .It wouldn't take a lot of effort",
    "Camp sites were well maintained and easy to find. They have large trash cans and potable water spickets at each site which is great. The small little gas station has firewood, ice and, WiFi if needed. THERE IS ZERO PHONE SERVICE - not a bad thing, just plan for it. We stayed in site number 8 and was really great. It looked like site 9 was likely the best on the property. As mentioned there was no shade so plan accordingly. Host was extremely responsive and professional to questions and helping us find the place. Not sure if we had a specific weekend or if this happens a lot but both nights starting at 9:30 the wind was howling. I would plan accordingly with larger stakes. And if you are a light sleeper, bring a lot more coffee!",
    "I'm going to do my best to keep this review neutral. Check in instructions failed to mentioned that host is not available after 6pm when the gas station closes. Tent site #6 is right next to the road, maybe 50 ft or less. Thankfully the road is not heavily traveled.The site was covered with wood chips/mulch, about 4 inches deep - probably to help prevent thorny vegetation from growing which still popped up in places - however you can't anchor a tent into wood chips, so we had to dig to find ground in order to anchor our tent.A portable toilet was also situated near site #6 and every so often you would get an unpleasant whiff.While it was never claimed to be accessible, the creek appeared mostly inaccessible, which was disappointing. There just was not a lot of area for a person to walk around which kind of left you just staying at your site.So we opted not to stay at the location after one night, and found a more desirable disperse site along Ten Mile Road.We did not contact the host about our misgivings of our site selection as we did not feel another site would improve our view point significantly.Again, there wasn't anything inherently wrong or misrepresented about the listing. It just wasn't what we were looking for.",
    "Decent campground with all the basic amenities you need (water, bathrooms, picnic tables). We visited during a heat wave and started at site #6. It had zero shade so sleeping past 6-7am was not an option but after asking we moved across the street to a shaded spot. WiFi is $4 (not sure if it's per hour or day), haven't tried it. We didn't get the chance to try the ice cream either since we were out most of the time. People running the campground all seemed very nice! I would stay again if other campgrounds in Kings Canyon were booked.",
    "The location of this campground is great, it’s right in between both parks and is relatively a short distance from town. However the map online for the tent sights is a little misleading and we were next to a protapotty that smelled unpleasant (not the whole time but still not ideal). Over all though it was a great place to stay!",
    "We had a great time at the tent site. It was quiet and safe, and the bathroom was clean. Loved the ice cream and the antique gas pump! It was too hot to hang around the campsite during the day (July), but we planned to be out exploring anyway. At nighttime it was comfortable. We did have a rattlesnake come through our camp, so please be prepared for that and don't let your dog nose around too much. The first night the a buzzing sound (generator? water pump? not sure) kept me up a little but the second night I fell asleep without noticing it.",
    "Loved the location. Owner was not there 8-5 as stated. Felt it should have more over site as people were having fires during a No Fire time that was fully stated.",
    "The location was easy to reach and our hosts instructions were easy to follow. The campsite is convenient access but has a few cons - 1) if you’re in the sites across the road be careful if you’re in a sedan. The access road is steep and you’ll end up scratching your chassis/ side of your car when you get out. 2) our location had no trees at all providing shade. This was definitely a bummer as it got waaay to hot to handle after 8 am each morning 3) some of the tent site region is still under development and is very dusty. That said a few plus points - you’re a short drive from the best Kings Canyon attractions- Hume Lake, Grizzly Falls and Boyden Cavern. This place has ice cream, gas and firewood for sale which is a huge plus point! All in all, a few solid areas for improvement but overall a good choice to camp at!",
    "Bathroom was clean and scenery was beautiful. The site itself was very over priced for a camp site. Bring your shoes because there are stickers everywhere that poke through sandals. There are cows that wander through so be ready to shovel poop and tie up your dogs if they like to chase them. Upon arrival we mentioned that we were not going to stay both nights that we reserved and unfortunately we were not able to get a refund for the second night we didn't stay. Perhaps if you have a large group that wants to camp away from it all this would be a good spot for you.",
    "the campsites (Creekside 3) was just a bit expensive for where it was located (adjacent to the road) and what was provided.",
    "It definitely wasn’t exactly as advertised, yellow jackets/hornets should’ve been talked about in the description since they were everywhere as well. I don’t feel the price is worth the site at all. There is a service fee added to the price… there wasn’t even a trash can to lock your trash in which I feel there should’ve been considering the cost of the site.",
    "Very quiet, beautiful meadow to camp in under the oak tree and next to the creek.",
    "It’s very quiet and remote and the sites are part of very dense green woods. We were against a little road but no car traffic. If you camp in a tent, the ground for site #1 has a lot of bumps. The chemical toilet hadn’t been emptied in a while. For the price $150+ a night, it’s a bit pricey.",
    "The directions getting there were simple enough and the space we had was a little more secluded than the other camping spots, which was nice with a group of four and a dog. The property itself was absolutely beautiful. However, our Creekside spot was supposed to come with a tent deck and a private path down to the creek, but we couldn’t access either. A giant tree branch had fallen some time before we arrived onto the tent deck and wasn’t cleared off before we got there. This gave us little space to work with and cramped up the camp a bit. The only other downside to this spot was the overgrown poison oak EVERYWHERE. There is no previous warning that there will be poison oak and three out of our four campers are highly allergic. Had we known about the overgrown poison oak creeping into our camp, we definitely would’ve chosen another spot. This spot is not quite worth the money you pay, however, we checked out the redwood spots and they looked like they’d definitely be worth the price.",
    "rude host. overflowing porta pottie. no one ever checked the site or the campers. kind of a rip off",
    "the access road was not adequate for a Prius. Don't go down that road if you don't have a vehicle with high clearance or even a 4x4. Also, we were out of luck, some other campers blasted music until after 3 AM. Not ideal when camping with young children...",
    "Lots of wild animals which was pretty scarey at night. Zero curtesy response to any of our text which the host asked us to send before and upon arrival.",
    "For me the only negative was the traffic that was occasional but went into the wee hours of the morning. I’m a light sleeper and it didn’t work for me only because of this. Would love to try the other set of sites on this ranch someday.",
    "To no fault of the host, we got stuck in a site with a wicked breeze it just wouldn't let up, we were staked in with cars blocking our site and unfortunately we couldn't hold back Mother Nature. The grounds and drive to the sites are incredible. Will be back and will choose a more off the beat bath with some larger trees to block from the wind.",
    "Sites 1 & 2 or just ok. Site 3 is better but still near the road. Sites 4 & up are way better across the creek.",
    "Expensive, given the price, need a great view and or services to justify - this site doesn't have those",
    "The sites aren’t really camp sites, just cleared areas in the woods. ",
    "I was not satisfied with this campsite, the map was deceiving and we were not aware that we would be directly next to a highway (not even any trees dividing it from our campsite - just some grass) with cars constantly zooming by and being awoken by headlights.

    "I don’t think I’ll be going back to this place again, we couldn’t even have a fire which I understand because of the circumstances but my expectations were to have one so it was disappointing in that sense. There also weren’t very many flats areas to pitch a tent everything was downhill so plan accordingly for that as well. Very close neighbors was also a downside to the camping spot.",
    "I will say that The camp sites are far too close together if you are looking for a campground with wide open quite spaces. if you don’t mind seeing your neighbors then it’s a pretty standard campground. The frogs are quite loud at night. Our site had one flat space for a tent but got a ton of morning and evening sun. Bring a shade structure. The bathrooms were clean and well kept but there was only one for the entire campground so we frequently had a line.",
    "The campsite fee increase of $5 was fine but the $10 online service fee was a slap in the face. I’ll just “show up” next time and take my chances. The map for the campground is now impossible to find on the website. The host said it’s there somewhere and offered to provide guidance, but I had already reserved my site through the third party group by then.",
    "There were pine needles EVERYWHERE in our site and in everyone else’s for that matter. Not only could that have been a fire hazard but it would have been nice to arrive in a CLEAN campsite. This is a small attention to detail that would go a long way.",
    "Our particular site was rocky, especially in the main walkways. I stubbed my toe a couple of times.",
    "People do not understand what the concept of a KOA is. Its not to go camping out in the middle of nature and take in the stars and see a bear walking around",
    "Upon arriving to this campground, I happened to step in human feces in the bathroom stall. Then we got a surprise when we arrived to our site. We had planned to cook over a fire that night, but, as it happened, our cabin did not happen to come with a fire pit. The basketball hoop was in the middle of the road so, as it happened, there were cars interrupting our game at every given moment.",
    "We stayed in this camp site in the first two nights of our camping trip. It was pretty nice with a lot of pine trees and shady location where is near to the restroom. It was our first camping experience, we were adjusting to the new surrounding at the first night. The temperature is very different from day to night. It was hot in the day time, but freezing cold at night. I was awakened by the coldness at the first night and couldn’t fall back to sleep after I tugged back to my sleeping bag. I felt awful about the fact that I was lack of sleep. My hubby did not sleep well either-he was awaken by someone’s loud snore nearby. That is one of the drawbacks in camping",
    "Campground is tough, dirty and tiring, not to mention the lousy quality of sleep.",
    "We will never go there again! It was awfull!",
    "It is hard to reduce to words how bad the tent ‘campsites’ are. They are not really ‘campsites,’ they are just a road that has a series of places to set up a tent on a portion of the road and shoulder thereto. There is a very real possibility of someone’s tent getting run over or hit by a car here.",
    "We got turned away from the lake itself because I had my bearded dragon with me. I wanted to let her get some sun and enjoy myself at the same time. Well, one of the wardens told me I had to have her on a leash if I wanted to be around the lake because he didn’t want her ‘jumping in and harming the delicate ecosystem.",
    "A lizard on a leash. Riiiiiight…",
    "After we came back, I spent a whole day cleaning and washing. everything was dirty! I strained my arm muscle washing tons of clothes and camping stuff. It is not that much fun! I will never go on a camping trip again! It is Work! Not a vacation! I rather spend on a hotel instead of a camp site. It is just not worth it!",
    "We were told that they had wifi. What we weren’t told is that they have it configured so badly that it is impossible for anyone to access it. The ineptitude of this campground’s IT skills made my life incredibly difficult while staying there. There is no TV, you cannot get any radio stations, and you should just plain forget about trying to use a cell phone, because it’s just not going to happen. Unless you stand in the middle of the highway-which, if you’re unfortunate enough to stay here, you might want to do anyway…out of sheer depression.",
    "That night a group literally had a dance party. They were respectful if you came over, but you shouldn’t have real DJ with color lights, a mixing table, and professional speakers out at midnight in a KOA.",
    "Don’t expect to catch up on the news: cable TV isn’t available, and while there is wifi, you’re going to have to pay an additional fee if you want to use it.",
    "After our bikes were stolen, the security guard said that they have had a theft of at least once a week since Sept 2010 and often more than that during the summer. The detective in Tourist Crimes with the Las Vegas Police Department said the same thing. Specifically the thieves target rental RVs but others are also at risk. If they don’t take bikes off the RV then they break a window and take electronics etc from inside the RV. The thieves always come around just after sunset when people are at dinner and then are gone by around 8 pm. Of course if you haven’t had anything stolen you don’t think it is a problem. We would have appreciated at least a warning from the KOA staff since they are well aware of the problem",
    "If you do risk going there, the best bet is to buy the cheapest used bike possible and leave it out as a decoy. That way, they won’t bust a window and go through your stuff on the inside.",
    "The place (Camp 4) basically was nothing but a noisy zoo filled with screaming, trash-throwing monkeys. There’s no peace or quietness in that camp, no sleep at all (how are you supposed to get up early to start your long hike and how do you recover from workouts without sleep?)",
    "Why do I give this place one star? Stupid, drunk, 30-year-old Jersey-Shore-wannabe douchebags blaring ’90s rap and ’70s classic rock from their boom box 24/7 while rambling about how Robert Plant is still the most amazing musician alive. You know the type, right? Ugh.",
    "Also, for some reason this place thinks 10pm is not quiet time, it is do NOT make a sound because staff are hiding in the trees watching your every move. SERIOUSLY DON’T FART YOU WILL GET YELLED AT We could not even whisper at our campfire because the staff was consistently bugging us to quiet down when it was them making the noise telling us to quiet down. But don’t worry, because you will listen to RV generators all night long.",
    "On our final night a camper managed to steal a Golf Kart from one of the security guards and as he recklessly drove through the camp he hit our tent and almost ran over our daughter.",
    "This campsite is awful!. We were meant to be staying there tonight but left after only a couple of hours and found a budget motel instead (even after paying for the night). The tent spaces are tiny and there is not enough room to pitch a tent and park your car in most of them. It is more like a refugee camp than a camp site. There we're some very shady looking characters walking around the place including through the back of our pitch with packs of beer. I dont mean just your average camper with a beer. I think a lot of the people onsite may have been there long term and it felt more like a dodgy trailer park than a campsite. Many of the pitches had tarps connecting tents together or temporary structures coming off them.The washrooms although not great we're not the worst i ve seen at a campsite but the whole place feels unsafe, which is why we left.",
    "We have done a lot of camping and i have stayed in city campsites before and none have been anywhere near this bad. I would have rather of just parked on the street and slept in the car than use this place.",
    "Far TOO expensive for amenities provided. Most outrageous online booking system. Pick your site, RESERVE the site, pay deposit (first nite’s stay). BUT there is an additional $25 to guarantee your site # will be reserved (queue Seinfeld episode). If you don’t pay the ADDITIONAL $25 Reservation fee, they will give your site to anyone who has reserved another site for the same day, but arrives before you, and chooses to set up there. This is what happened to our friends who had a “reservation” to be beside us on one of the only 3 full-serviced sites. They ended up a few lots away with only water and hydro AND NO REFUND for the lesser serviced site (still paid premium price). PLUS, because they have 4 kids, they were told that they had to pay $10/day/child for 2 kids b/c they had more than 2 kids. This was post Labour Day and the only activity offered was a 10 minute wooden trailer ride (pulled by a tractor) on Fri. and Sat. nite. The heated pool (NOTE - read other reviews) was closed (understandably). So what were the extra fees/child for? ** Also note other reviews for this park regarding expensive fees, $25 reservation fee and $25 early check in penalty (if you show up as few as 30 mins. earlier, prior to check in time as posted in your confirmation Reservation e-mail). Took a good look as we left b/c we’re never going back",
    "if your going to stay here better read this, i here its nice i guess ill never find out, this is our story. on June the 8th we reserved 4 night for the 16th to 20th, and if i wanted to cancel i would have to have done it by the 9th, not much time and they took half the amount from my visa $92.00 . so on Saturday afternoon my husband had taken a kidney stone attack and was amidated to the hospital, the next day i called the camping to tell them that we will be unable to make it to the camping because the stone had been given him a lot of pain and would be on medication for 1 week and will be unable to drive our motorhome, i asked for a refund and i refused on the spot without question. the next day we send them a email with pictures that he was in the hospital and the prescription that the doctor had given him and now its been 3 days and nothing from the camp ground, dont even have the courtesy the email us or even call, so if your going to go here be aware of this place they like your money but dont care if you show or not. pass this on to everyone so maybe some other people would not get caught in this trap.",
    "Go elsewhere ......   We camped in site C9 which was terrible thanks to an extremely large and noisy industrial generator that powers the entire resort. It ran 24/7. We couldn’t hear each other talking from across the campfire. They should have built some sort of noise barrier shielding the generator from the campsites in that area. When we arrived Friday the garbage was already overflowing from the limited garbage bins and by Monday morning there were bags of garbage laying on the ground. Definitely irresponsible and poor planning by the resort owners, especially considering we had a beautiful bear visit us in our campsite Sunday at dinner time. The sites are long but many are very narrow. Our friends beside us in C8 had to put their picnic table behind their trailer because the site was too narrow to have it beside their trailer and the fire pit was also at the far rear of the trailer because the site is too narrow. Water pressure was very low and barely trickled out at times. No cell service so make sure you have trail maps etc downloaded before arrival. Two different staff there had no idea what was in the area other than the other commercial ventures -Helicopter and horseback. I would expect staff to have some general idea of the area. One staff couldn’t even provide directions for the campsite trail to the lake.",
    "Less than mediocre at best......   I have a whole other review elsewhere (Tripadvisor, Facebook) about my personal experience with the management and staff at this site. However, in reading the guidelines, I would like to comment that this campsite is below our expectations in terms of facilities and campsite layout. There is no separation between sites. You are face to face with your neighbours so there is no privacy. The sites are small unless you have one of the RV spots or group camping sites. The washrooms are more often dirty than clean and the showers have little to no water pressure. There is a central playground which is nice for all the kids to go to and parents don't have to worry about them going too far. The river is beautiful and perfect for a hot sunny day. I would absolutely not recommend this place if you would like to be left alone by staff. Quiet time is 10PM but was being enforced as early as 6PM with the threat of eviction if not complied with. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",
    "We were put on site 54 on 14th Avenue. The site is all sand, no grass or gravel. We spend a vast majority of our time just trying to keep our mat outside of our trailer clean, I have put a tarp down which helps somewhat. It has rained today and now the sand sticks to everything it touches. We have 2 dogs which are also impossible to keep clean in this sand. It is pretty much a necessity to rent the golf cart for 230.00 a week as the pools and all attractions are located at the front of the resort which is a half hour walk.",
    "No refunds. I had no campfire, no internet and there is no cell service at all. I was staying for a week and was given worst site. All were rude except Hope was very helpful and kind. They need more employees like her at this site. It is a very lovely spot for a stop over. Didn’t rate showers, had to pay for use.",
    " Worst camping experience here! Staff were rude and very arrogant. Extra charges for booking fee, and wi-fi and would not provide a refund if you are not satisfied with your site. Would not recommend this campground. Lots of nicer campgrounds in the area with much better customer service! Dump station is very difficult to access and very tight u-turns necessary to access and again to exit.",
    "The staff here is so incredibly rude!!! The centre here provides grey/black tank emptying totes to empty your tanks. We were camping with a few other families, so the older boys offered to go around and empty the grey tanks for us. Long story short, the tote the centre supplied had a small hole and a little trail of grey water made a trail. JUST WATER!!! The owner of the campground came out and started yelling and swearing at the boys. I came to their defence stating the tote is only carrying water, and there wasnt any need to yell and swear at the boys, at which point he tells me to shut your mouth, just shut your f-ing mouth !! This is from the owner of the campground!! We will ever Return to that campground again!! P.S. As a review posted earlier, the owner has multipul cats running free. Twice the cats have torn through our garbage. The bathrooms were disgusting, and through out the campground there is old equipment, broken fences/tables, and truck parts littering this campground.",
    "We booked a night at this campground to visit friends, we told them we had a 40' Motor Coach that is 30,000 lbs and did they have sites to accommodate. When we arrived at the gate the driveway in is lined with trees that scratched the sides of the coach, then upon getting to our site - they put is in a sand pit with regulars (all drinking beer with several dogs running around barking). taking over the entire site. We had to get the regulars to moves their vehicles which were parked on the site. Then we got stuck and could not maneuver around because the regulars had decks and canopies hanging over the site. We finally got unstuck and called the office see if they had a site more suitable, the owner of the park came by with a small tractor (to try and pull us out) and said we could move up a few spaces but there was no hydro there. We decided to leave and would NEVER go back to the resort, it is in no way shape or for suitable for a motorcoach.",
    "BEWARE, BEWARE!!! Read reviews and take heed of the bad reviews as they are very similar to our experience. Beautiful park and great for young kids....after 11, make sure you are in bed or you will be told! They have a rules section and if they feel that you have broken any in the slightest, they will evict you and your sleeping children in the middle of the night at the drop of a hat. They are a fringe religious group running the place with scripture posted on buildings. They sneak around and spy in the dark, video tape any interaction and are very ignorant from the first moment if they don't like you. Don't try and reason with them, they are not right in the head. We had a female police officer with us and they showed her no respect when she tried to speak with them. We were warned by other campers when we arrived but didn't realize just how bad it was. We were in no way, out of line in the slightest. They don't want anyone up and around the fire after 11. It was like a creepy horror movie. We are veteran family campers and will NEVER go here again nor recommend it to anyone.",
    " Location is very nice. Staff is very lax. Washroom's have not been updated in St least 25 years. Oldy moldy shower not nice. Lions Club operators seem to take but never invest in the buildings etc. Water is poisoned with benzene and no safe drinking water is provided. Look elsewhere for better value at full prices.",
    "  We arrived ready to camp at this campground only to be told that site we reserved was not available due to rain and it was muddy. The owner did not want vehicles parked in the grass. So he didn't have proper water irrigation to handle the rain - not our fault. He then proceeded to tell us we could check other sites in that area so we got in the car and some idiot with a huge trailer on the back of his vehicle from BC that thinks the world revolves around him pulls in and blocks us from getting into the campground and gets out and goes in the office so instead of him pulling back or parking somewhere else in the lot we had to go around him to check out the other campsites which we were not happy with. We went back to the office to see what could be done only to have the owner cop an attitude with us telling us he would only charge us for one night but instead charged us for 2 of the 3 nights we were booked for. We asked about the possibility of coming back the following weekend (which their site says the offer rain checks) but the owner refused. So we left and will NEVER go there again. Please stay far away from this campground.",
    "We asked that they come clear out the garbage that was floating in our fire pit ..yes the pit got moved ..left all the garbage..asked again the next day to have the garbage removed..nope ..gross. No we won't be back there were more problems then that but those are the ones we directly contacted them about.",
    "owner is loopy makes up rules on the fly goes out of his way to not make you feel welcome.his web site is not very accurate.there is no usable beach.he let us in the park then 3 weeks later told us our trailer was too old,if we wanted to sell it would have to be pulled.all in all I would steer clear of this one",
    "Website is very deceiving. The overnight spots are not clearly marked and therefor you are packed in any way they can fit you, creating a difficult situation with your neighbours. It caused confusion and fighting between campers that you had to stay beside. You may have just enough space to open your awning but will be inches away from the neighbour beside you creating no privacy at all. Definitely not a family friendly campground like the website says. Not much to do for the kids there. There is no beach, just a pool with a broken hot tub that looks like it hasn't been used for years. Although the owners were nice to my family, I witnessed on more than one occasion the owners being very rude and yelling at young kids, which made me very uncomfortable for leaving my kids alone to play. The kids park was run down and not maintained, i didn't want my kids playing on it as it looked dangerous and was worried they would get hurt. I would not recommend this park to anyone especially families.",
    "We arrived on Wednesday at 5PM and immediately were surprised by the less than 5 meters distance between our tent pad and the nearest neighbor (there is not any trees or shrubs in between). After setting up our tent and finish simple meal. We went to play frisbee in the green space, then rest in the pavilion to have some boardgames. We jogged back to tent around 8:30PM and went to bed by 9. We woke up ~7:30AM next morning and while we had breakfast, we were being told we had made excessive noise late last night and early this morning. Due to our neighbor complaint, the camp ranger made the call to kick us out immediately, and we have to pack up in an hour then leave... We were so surprised and went to the office to discuss with the park ranger: 1) We went to the green space away from camping area to minimize the disturbance and went to bed at 9PM. Did that mean we need to be in complete silence even playing sport in playground and green space? 2) We woke up at 7:30AM, and probably the cooking noise woke up our neighbor. It is difficult for us not making any noise during cooking, while another tent was just steps away... 3) The provided silence hours rule is 11PM to 7AM, and we did not break the rule 3) Without any warning or onsite investigation, the camp ranger sent someone to kick us out. We prepaid for 4 days fee and could only sleep there one night... The received response was He is the camp ranger, and he can kick out anyone at his own discretion with the right not providing any warning or refund. There was no room for discussion, and we were being kicked out immediately..",
    "Our Labour day 2016 weekend was very disappointing at Woodlands. The staff/owners were incredibly rude to deal with. There was a mistake due to a booking change they had made and they flat out refused to credit us back our money. Then just laughed when we stated that we will never camp here again. We have been coming here with a group of 8 (some years more) for the last 6 years. And they treated us like we were just garbage. There are many other campgrounds around Sauble Beach to stay at I would highly recommend one of them. http://www.saubleresortcamp.com/ http://www.carsonscamp.com/ http://www.windingrivercampground.com/ http://www.whitesandscampground.com/ I am sure one of these other places will actually appreciate your business. Read the reviews on here, everyone that loved  their stay never once had to deal with the staff or owners. To be fair we never did until this year either and look at the outcome.",
    "I was very disappointed with this campground. In previous years, we have stayed there and the owners were pretty easy to get along with. That did not happen this time...our children were told to get off the playground when they were not doing anything wrong, friends (with young children)who were visiting us (and who had paid $3 each) wanted to actually stay the night and were willing to pay, they were told that the did not reserve ahead of time and could not stay which I find ridiculous. Also, there were only 7 unisex washrooms for the whole campground.....not enough.",
    "Worst camping experience of my life!!!!!!......   AWFUL!!!!!! My girlfriend and I drove to Granite Ridge because the website showed nice photos and described how it is wilderness camping with quiet time from 11pm-9am. Anything BUT quiet!!!!!! Young kids with a monster boat (website says no gas powered boats or watercraft allowed) got the site right beside us even though there were about a dozen empty sites on the other side of us. Music and yelling until 4am!!!! When I asked them to turn it down as we were trying to sleep, I received an 'ummmm no!! It's going to get louder!! from or of the self-entitled 20 somethings. Called the owner to complain at 230 am. The husband came and told them to keep it down. They turned the music off until he left and then turned it back on again. This music source was maybe 20' from our tent. Ended up sleeping in the car!!! Asked twice for a refund for this one night...by phone and by email....didn't even receive a reply back. Do yourself a favour and avoid this place at all costs!!!! Dirty, noisy, and crappy customer service!!! We will NNNNNNEVER go back there ever again!!!!!! Some other points I forgot to mention: Yellow water in a lot of the outdoor hookups which looked identical to urine!!! No garbage bins anywhere!!! Roads through the campground are full of potholes!! Rules are not enforced on any real level!",
    "Located way off the beaten path, and if that's what you are looking for, perfect. No internet service, no tv, seems to be no rules, no campsite cleaning, dump station exists, good luck... an old camp recently purchased by a group of the seasonal's. Every one is related to, or knows someone. You can do better.",
    "With there being quite a number of campgrounds in the area I been going to some beforehand to get a map of the park and take a look at the camp sites. I have done this probably 10 campgrounds in the area and they have all been more than willing to let us take a drive through. Having read the reviews on Gagnon Beach this sounded like a good place to go. When we arrived you could see the trailers were very close to each other. We were told they have the odd campsite for overnitghters scattered here and there. When we asked if we could take a drive through to see the camp sites we were told no. What the? We very quickly scratched this campground off our list and will not even consider going there. Very poor attitude.",
    "They overbooked the campground with a youth group of approx 40 pers and have only two washrooms. These rooms were dirty.",
    "  The following conversation took place at reception (after filling in the reg. form): - Staff: I need a credit card number - Me: I will pay cash or debit - Staff: I will still need a CC number? - Me: Why, I said I am going to pay cash, there is no need for CC besides, I might not have one - Staff: It is the policy - Me: I travelled all across Canada, this is the first campground (TRUE) that wanted a CC number after payment. So why? - Staff: You might do something - Me: To the campsite? Like what, empty the minibar? If you want pls come an check in the morning. - Staff: I will call management. This took approx. 10 minutes then, we gracefully accepted. They gave us the worst site in the campground at the highest rate (all other sites were empty). The boss didn't dare to show himself. Dear (unknown) owner: Your campground might look tidy, nice and everything looks allright, if you don't understand the basics of hospitality you should change the profession.",
    " A total rip off ,they charged8.50 for a small bag of wood slabs which burne in 10 mins and after burning 14 bags for the week adds another 150 to the 292 for the week.Told to turn music down at 1pm in afternoon,rude owners constantly monitoring everything you do.Told to shut music off at 11pm sharp and no talking by fire after that.They run this place like a military camp will never return.On top of that they charge for showers!!!!!!",
    "The camping staff/owners were very rude. We were a group of 12 ppl, 5 adults e 6 kids. From the check in time to the time to leave, we felt not welcome there. Under the impression because we not pure white Canadian...All places were sold out, unfurtunataly we had to stay. Very price, playground still under construction, pool was dirty, showers has no privacy! Will never come back.",
    "We were at Woodland RV Park but couldn't get a site for the long weekend (even though we had stayed 14 nights. We had reservations at Fisherman's Cove in Kincardine (don't go unless you like kids and lots of noise)but needed a place to stay for 3 nights. We booked a pull-thru as our RV is 38' but knew we had made a mistake when we arrived at our site as the RV barely fit in the site. We only had a few feet between us and the sites beside us so we could hear everything they said. My wife was so disgusted she didn't leave our RV for almost the entire stay. It is obvious the owners are only interested in making money as the squeezed as many people in a possible. My only question is why would you buy a seasonal site in a dump like this? Also the name Sauble Beach RESORT is very, very misleading and so far from a resort it isn't even funny!! Stay away from this park unless you like feeling like a sardine. WON'T BE BACK TO THIS HOLE!!!!",
    "The campground adverts itself as Panoramique, eg having a view over the St. Laurence River - nope; only few privileged sites have a view; the restaurant was awful, the worst food we ever had. The pool closes at eight - and this for 60 CAD!! NB: We traveled from Vancouver to Halifax, this was the worst campground we ever stayed at!",
    "Awesome and clean park!! My hubby and I have camped there for 40 years now and still there. Good size lots and clean bathrooms! Have a nice rec hall where activities go on for children and adults as well. There is horseshoes, basket ball courts, trampoline, play ground, and a big pool. The owner Dale is very friendly and always there to help you. The Park is close to store malls and grocery stores. We have Christmas in July and Halloween later in the season which is a big hit. I would recommend this Park!!",
    "This is a lovely campgroung, but the owners are absolutley abominale. Very unfriendly, and their prices are through the roof. The owner rides in his golf cart trying to find fault with every camper, plus the wife is always miserable, keep away",
    "The customer service is terrible. If you have a trailer site, you still need to pay $30.00 to set up a tent on the same lot. So if you have a small trailer and have children then you are paying double the price. I think that the new owners need to evaluate the way things are run. I will not be back to this campground.",
    "I had many safety concerns when staying here. We have 5 kids ranging from 7 to 14. The quarry filled with water has a platform kids jump off of. Bottom platform is directly below top platform. If bigger kids jump off without being careful of younger kids below, a child could die or be seriously injured, as the platform is pretty high. I concerned enough to pull kids out. Water is so dark, a child could drown and no one would notice, as you can't see the bottom. The swinging Tarzan rope is also a concern, if kids miss letting go, there are rocks everywhere along the cliff-like edge. Very crowded campground, hardly any space between sites. Loud and bad language is everywhere. Kids are often left unsupervised and as the campground is busy and full, the layout does not allow parents to keep an eye on the kids easily. Basically, it is an ok campground, but there is surely a lawsuit looming, the day someone gets seriously injured. I find it hard to believe an insurance company would insure a place such as this...Our kids enjoyed it, but safety wise, it is quite scary!",
    "   Bathrooms all locked up. Paid for serviced site,but no power and no water. In fairness I stayed here once in the summer and it was fine. However it is chilly night, my RV batteries are low, the caretaker is nowhere to be found and my phone calls have not been returned by management.",
    " Teenagers damaged personal property, owners were unprofessional and did nothing to correct",
    "Poor camping experience. We were tenting as a family, the tenting campsites were very poor (2 of the sites had abandoned tents that the owners had no idea), washrooms were disgusting and you pay for showers.",
    "Do not stay here.Upon arrival we knew we had made a mistake. The site was the smallest site I've ever seen with no privacy at all between each site. Every new arrival we heard come in had nothing but negative reviews upon arrival. The bathrooms were disgusting and to take a shower cost you $1 for every 5 minutes. I know that's not much but when every aspect of this campground has been very sub par it's just one more reason not to come here. At 10pm we had to turn off our radio that could barley be heard from 10 ft away. We bought firewood from the on site store that was very wet and when we used fluid to try and start it we were asked not too. The site supervisor then denied the wood came from their store. All in all this has to be one of the worst campgrounds we have ever spent time at. Stick to well known private parks or provincial parks.",
    "never go back.First I booked a pull thru (33ft trailer) when I arrived, they said they didn't have a pull thru available, I booked it 5 months prior. the owner would drive around in a golf cart stopping at each site checking to check it out, he was walking around the back of our trailer, when he thought we where not in it. I could go on & on, just don't go there.",
    "The pond was disgusting and when you took the paddle boats out you was having to clean all of the weeds and slime from underneath the boat.My daughter was always wanting to go in them but it was alot of work to paddle to get anywhere and on top of that they charged to take them out for 30 minutes,Well I know we never lasted 10 minutes.It was dissapointing.",
    "Not well maintained. Quite dirty. Drainage problem, so all grounds and sites are constantly wet and muddy, even when there hasn't been rain in many days. Quite loud, bad language. Not a great spot for little kids.",
    "Nice creek on site. Not impressed with slower than slow WiFi. Suggest bringing your own drinking water, had the scoots the whole time we were there.",
    "Nice location, internet extremely poor, some issues with quality of drinking water.",
    "Why would anyone want to camp here. It is located between highway 401 (a major trucking route) and Windsor Airport, so the noise never stops at any time - day or night. It is full of loud drunk people on busy weekends, not to mention the seasonals driving their golf carts around at midnight. The full service sites are basically a large open space with hardly any foliage at all, and you feel like you are in some trailer park, crammed in on top of one another. The owner, Ed, is quite miserable and will find a way to have a problem with you. The wood is overpriced - you get around 8 pieces for $7.50, and the store is under-stocked. There are many other campgrounds in the area, and even though they may be a longer drive to Windsor, it would be completely worth it to make the longer trip. It may be okay for young singles (the required age is 21 to rent a site for some reason, not 18 or 19), but it isn't a place I would take a family who wants to go camping to get away from a busy life in the city. Sure, there may be a pool, fishing, and a playground, but what campground doesn't have this, at least nearby. After the experiences we've had here (and we are quite tolerable), we don't plan on ever returning.",
    "Worst campground ever.Horrible place,it has old RV in the woods,the pool was green. The staff were rude. Don't waste your money",
    "Just ok.This campground looked pretty wonderful on line. Appeared to have the river on one side, surrounded by trees. It has a river, but a chain link fence and bushes keep you away. Also the other 3 sides appear to be bordered by roads. The sites are very small. Location is wonderful. Washing machines and dryers are nice. Very clean room. But there is no change machine. Oops yes there is, but only takes Canadian money. We were visiting from USA. Had to go to bank to get change. When we checked in, we were not offered any tourist info. We were also told there was no cable tv. But there was cable, so we hooked up and it did work.",
    "Stay away from this place, very very unpleasant female host, allows crackhead and drunks to live there, but chases away the good people, RCMP in this place a number of times last summer, dirty coin showers, broken but still in use washing machine, erratic office hours, blown out lightbulbs in washroom and park grounds, pitch dark at night, often for days at a time, only the guests are there, nobody looking after the place, POWER SURGE PROTECTOR for rvs highly recommended. Take your own loonies for the showers and laundry, if the office is open, they don't always have change for you. We left with a week remaining on our monthly rent. And they want 5.00 a day for extra vehicles, including motorcycles and bike trailers, work crews - don't stay here for that reason, dog poop and cig butts on the beach, overflowing garbage dumpster is the norm, attracts bears, I could go on and on, we stayed here for 18 months over a 24 month period, this place is going downhill as I write this.",
    "High price,hard ground.Highest priced tent sites on Alaska Highway.Ground is exposed rocks or roots.Sites are next to above ground gasoline tanks.Bring a flashlight as washroom entranceways are unlit,washrooms unheated and showers cost a dollar for a fast two minutes.Laundry room is expensive and always packed with people using internet.Internet is hotspot that covers about ten percent of sites,so everyone uses laundromat.No cellphone service on entire site,so you have to drive down the highway to call anyone.",
    "unfortunate.we were there in june 2014 and were very disappointed. they had us park our trailer in mud, literally - step out of the trailer directly in mud. we were hoping to get credited for leaving early but were not given a credit as these camping conditions were due to rain/nature. play structures are old and in dire need of update at least for security purposes. everything from wood to renting canoe is more expensive than what we have seen elsewhere. manager in front office is rude and not centered on client satisfaction.",
    "nothing justifies a weekend at this campsite unfortunately :(",
    "AVOID!!! AVOID!!! AVOID!!!!Wow is all I have to say. Cranky staff and a campground in need of MAJOR repairs. I feel sorry for this campground because it has the potential to be excellent. It's in the valley and near the zoo. My family and I were so very disappointed with this place. Hopefully things change for this poor campground.",
    "Excessive cancelling fees.My wife reserved at this campground and did not see (or think to look for) the fine print related to cancellation of a reservation. She went ahead and booked 2 sites for 3 nights (we were going to camp with a friend). Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, we had to cancel nearly a week before the camping date. Since I travel a lot, I am very familiar with hotel cancellation policies that require to cancel before 4pm the day of arrival to avoid fees. So, naturally, I thought that being nearly a week before arrival, I would not be penalized (except for the $6 non-refundable reservation fee). This was not the case. We were charged a whopping $40 PER SITE for the cancellation. So, I got to pay $86 for a camping trip that never happened. It was a long weekend and a popular weekend for camping. All the campgrounds are sold-out each year during the labor day weekend and this one is no exception. They most certainly managed to book the campground after our cancellation. So, since I paid $86 in exchange for NOTHING, I figured that I earned the right to post a review to express my negative experience before even setting foot on the property. I would NOT recommend this experience to anyone. I would find a provincial site where their fees are regulated. Private campgrounds such as this one give themselves special rights to charge excessive fees when cancelling.",
    "We had checked this RV park out online saw that supposedly it was a luxury resort with a good access to Niagra Falls i! Especially the prices! However upon arrival we soon realized that it was not. Although the staff was pleasant, the sites were very small with no privacy. Hundreds of children everywhere. It was ok for the time we were here. Would have gone on except they do not refund. Bathrooms were not really clean and they charge for showers. We were here three nights in a travel trailer. Would not return. Most RV parks enforce their policies. They do not. Fireworks went on in the park until 11:p.m.",
    "I have never in my life met such unfriendly people that manage this park....this goes beyond as being the worst, most unfriendly rude people. Don't understand how these people could be placed in a management position.",
    "It is sad to see what has happened to Jay Lake Campground.It was such a lovely place and families had been going there for years. People got along, there were organized events. You enjoyed your time there. When the new owner took over in May of 2013 everything very rapidly changed. The previous owners were not perfect by any means but they cared about the residents and in their way were kind but a bit rough around the edges. The new owners' only interest was getting what they could out of you. They loved to intimidate the campers because it gave them a sense of power. End result was that a lot of seasonals left and the place is now up for sale. No campers, no money.",
    "We was seasonal campers here for a few years. We just left last year. If you aren't best friends with the owners don't be expecting no good treatment. Rules are different for every camper depending if they likes you or not. Rates go up and they don't ever do no upgrading. Peoples they know can jump the seasonal waiting list. We was never more glad to leave this campground. We loves camping in the valley and is so very happy to be at another campground just up the road from them who knows how to treat their campers.",
    "I was warned about this place and didn't listen. HA! My kids love Oaklawn Zoo and this campground is close to it which is the main reason we went. The staff are very cranky and the rec hall reaks of cigarette smoke. The washrooms are old and need to be fixxed up. There was also problems with power and water the weekend we were there and it was way too hot to be without AC. If we used more then one kitchen appliennce our power would shut off. If you do decide to go take your own wood for fires...theirs is tiny bundles and very expensive. Keep your kids away from the campground road as people drive very fast on it. This place could be great, but it's just not.",
    "A group of us went last summer. By group I mean retired without children. This campground is best suited for young people and young families. It's quite loud, a lot of partying that goes on quite late into the night, lots of kids in an already overcrowded pool, lots of kids running around screaming. There is an adult pool, but rowdy teens had taken it over while we were there. This is not a campground where you would go and relax. We might have enjoyed this more 20 years ago when our children were small. The washrooms are quite outdated and in need of repair. Overall not one we will be going back to.",
    "Very disappointed...... I am just getting ready to plan our vacation this summer and popped on this site for recommendations. We will not be staying at this campground again. We had been here previously years back when there were different owners and we had a great time. This past summer we went again. The whole time we were there, there were issues with power and water as well as cranky staff. I understand people were going to the office to complain, but put yourselves in our shoes....we are on vacation, paying customers without power and water, a little empathy would have gone a long way. We also ended up leaving early and went to Plantation which is just up the road and is amazing by the way with staff who are friendly and accommodating and their power and water worked just fine. Klahanie needs to do major upgrades and learn to be nice to their campers. This was a terrible experience for us.",
    "We were also there this past summer. We have a big camper so we need 30 amp service, which they do have. First there were problems with the water, which was then followed by problems with the power. We went to the office and the staff was rude and not willing to offer a refund. It was hot and we didn't have air conditioning which was fun with 3 small kids. The pool is always full of bigger kids splashing and jumping off the side which wasn't great for our small kids. The playground is nice, and that's the only thing we liked about this campground. We ended up leaving early because of the power and water problems and the fact they were not willing to offer a discount or refund because of it. We won't be back.",
    "Don't waste your time or money.Not sure what all the fuss is about with this campground. We went this past summer expecting an amazing weekend. First of all it's not cheap. Lots are expensive and the tiny bundles of wood are very expensive. The staff people were rude and the lady in charge was very moody and cranky. The activities they talk about which are supposed to be amazing are not, at all. This campground needs a lot of upgrades. Everyone kept losing power and water ALL WEEKEND. All this campground has going for it is that it is by the zoo, that s it. They need to seriously work on their customer service and do tons of upgrades or they are going to have an empty campground.",
    "Just Plain Nasty Owners. These are two people who took great pleasure in the power they felt as owners. I hope the park doesn't sell and the bank takes it. People lost half of the value of there trailers when they were not allowed to sell on site. That was the price to get away from them.",
    " I came across a listing for the park, and it is for sale. Thank God, we are praying for new owners, as the current owners are HORRIBLE! They make up rules on a weekly basis, they are planning on charging us $125 an hour if they have to cutting our grass if we do not make it up one weekend. This was part of the fees the previous years, but since these owners have come on board, things have gone down hill. Praying for new owners who have the common sense to listen to us and don't jack the rates up any higher then the current owners have. I think raising the rates close to 30%, this once was a great park, and heres to hoping it will be once these owners are GONE!!!!",
    "  This is for retired people or families will very young children. We left two days early because we were bored.",
    "This used to be very clean and well maintained. The showers are full of spiders and not clean and the washrooms are not clean. The lots above are too close together with no privacy. We used to love this place but after camping there this summer we will never go back, unless its for a day trip.",
    "Tent sites were small, staff need some extra customer service training. They have a pool which was nice, the location is the selling feature on this near to cranbrook. I wont be back. I'd rather stay at other campground, better rates, better services.",
    "Medium class at best. Staff was quite disinterested and actually wanted us to wait until she finished her (obviously private) telefone conversation. Campgrounds are nice, playground was not very well maintained, wifi was barely usable. Restrooms were OK.",
    "TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. Camped at this campground this summer with my family and my 12 years old grand daughter who was visiting from Florida. One of the owners of the camp ground must have been having a bad day because we didn't have our camp supplies unloaded from the vehicle and he was in our face, finger pointed and had my grand daughter in tears. This was certainly not called for. We had booked a four day camp stay two months prior for a particular site and called to confirm the reservation a week prior, when we got there it wasn't available. We left the next morning and went else where and the other camp ground staff couldn't do enough for us. MacLeods Beach Campsite is certainly not in any shape or form a favourable representation of our Cape Breton hospitality by a long stretch. Will never go back to that place. So buyer beware!!!!!!",
    "tayed here a couple of times over the past few years, not a problem. This year finally met one of the owners, a terrible person to deal with. very, very rude and only caters to the seasonal campers. My husband and I are both ex military and the people travelling with us one was an OPP officer from Ontario and I can assure you they were not impressed with the lack of professionalism from the whole MacLeod staff. We felt ashamed that our family and friends had to experience what is far from our Cape Breton hospitality. If you think you have to go there, don't bother making a reservation, it won't be available when you arrive anyway. The camp grounds and facilities are far from nice. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.",
    "Awesome park!! Terrible owners/ management The park owner needs to see hard times period! Nolan Vallery is a total moron, does not care about any of his short or Long term campers ... Needs some education.. Lives next door and takes target practice  boom boom boom all day long with a shot gun..(Riffle)Great way to impress your Campers no .. NEED I SAY MORE.. Not impressed !!!!!!!! If there is 500 sites there ..450 think that He is a #%}^^^#}{.. Just ask anyone!!!!! Great park, terrible owners!!!!!",
    "If you are a group if people do not stay here as you have to be super quiet which is quite challenging when your a group of thirty I don't think you should have to say shhh all the time no music is allowed we wanted to take out guitars n was told we weren't allowed to what a joke for a campground owner kept doin rounds like we were in prison till the final straw told us to loud n go back to ur own sights or would call cops we will be taking are gathering else were next year wow considering we dumped 700$ there n almost got kicked out for talkin to loud pathetc",
    "Boring, porta pottys which havent been cleaned, disgusting, kids got yelled at by the supposed owner, dont normally do this, but dont waste money",
    "website looked good, false, not a friendly place, bathrooms not clean, 2 porta potties for 300 people, showers dirty, garbage in them, owner ron wad also rude and was drinking alcohol, looks are deceiving.",
    "  Camp had dirty bathrooms, no upkeep. Owner ron was not friendly, sites are way to close, no privacy, basic rustic camp, with poor upkeep",
    "My family and friends recently stayed at Oakhill Pines Campground for 3 night but will not be going back anytime soon. Management is rude. Not very kid friendly and the bathrooms are gross. Last day of camping my husband went to shower and had sewer come up the shower. But management said it couldn't have happened. Only good thing was it was close to Bridgewater. Would not recommend this campground to anyone!",
    "It was horrible they charged you for everything.I wanna thank Vanessa,Chelsea,Elise,Keaton,Corey.They were great.They were great with my family.They should be credited how hard they work but they are not.The owner pulled me aside and said i was doing to much laundry because someone complained if im there first its first come first serve.they whined about my kids they treated staff awful in front of my children,then they would call a week before money was due harassing for more we stayed two months.Ridiculous You pay when it's due not a week early.The only thing that was good was it was clean they kept it mowed.They charged for extra vehicles and you were not allowed to put a tent on the lot with your camper.They wanted extra money for the third child that's awful.Some people have more than two kids.The. If u have visitors they want to charge u for the car and however many passengers are in the car.Im really upset with the way things were handled not just with us but other families that were there as well.Never again.Thanks again to the people I listed above.I appreciate how you guys treated my kids",
    "Worst Customer Service ever!.The owner of this park (Nolan Vallery) needs to go to school to learn about customer service. We had a terrible experience at this park. Nolans head is sooo big it wont fit through the door. Stay away not worth the time or the money.",
    "Owner has no customer experience at all!",
    "Website false advertises. No heated pool. Small sites not meant for slide outs.hot tub not running full of algae. No regard for reservations.Gave my site to someone else.loud partying all night.no privacy and tight to your neighbour. Not meant for overnight trailer campers. DO NOT RECOMMEND",
    "my husband and I stopped at the town and country campground to inquire about seasonal camping and Rv,s that were available for sale within the park. we arrived at 9:50 am and the office door was locked, witha sign that said 10am. I knocked and got no answer. another lady from within the park came along and knocked and the door was opened immediately. after this lady left I made my inquiries about seasonal camping. the lady I was talking to was very curt, rude and unhelpful. I asked if we could go in to look around to see if it was what we were looking for and she replied only campers are allowed in the campground, I left there shaking my head. I cannot imagine how someone with such a bad attitude towards other people can run a business that should be people friendly. if she is an employee she should be fired and if she is the owner, she should hire someone with people skills",
    "This campground is the worst ever! Run by a very rude lady!",
    "This by far has got to be the most disgusting campground around. We have been camping for ten years and I have never seen a more poorly run campground in all my life! The pool definitely needed a facelift, the office smelled disgusting and full of junk, and campgrounds were in terrible shape",
    "disgusting park. Most disgusting park I have been too. Total disregard for reservations made ahead of time, owmer doesn't care just wants your money. Website is totally false advertising. campsites are NOT private.Would never go back or recommend.",
    "Poor customer service. Road noise that carried on all night. Road construction started at 8:00. Mowing started at 10:00. No wifi in trailer had to go to office. No sewer hook up. Too much money for services not needed and none of the services we did need. Worst campground in a 2 month vacation. Did not use recreation facilities. Did not use washrooms and showers.",
    " Called today to cancel my reservation of Sept 6th and 7th. Was told there was no refund even though I cancelled approx. 1 month in advance. Now they can rent that campsite out and get double for those 2 nights. Was going to try there another time but with customer service like that not a chance. I'm out $77.00. Oh well, live and learn.",
    "Stay away.No customer service, this park just wants your money and doesn't care about anything else. Don't ask to speak to the owner because he is the leader of (I don't care if you come back attitude) washrooms were dirty and needed to be cleaned more often with the amount of people.",
    "Sites are small and close together, conflicting information from staff and extremely rude to my children and myself. Washrooms are very dirty and holes in ceiling. Pool was very small and cloudy. Difficult for small kids to ride bikes due to uphill and rough road.",
    " One of the least appealing campgrounds I've been in. Very small lot, not a very big campground, playground is poor, only good thing is that it is close to Bridgewater.",
    "Dirty Washrooms, Muddy swimmin' hole.Went on the Canada Day long weekend. Busy as hell. Line ups for the toilets. 2 out of the 3 toilets in the ladies room were out of order. One of the toilets overflowed, for 2 days the floor was wet & slippery with water, toilet paper, pee and feces. After it rained we had branches falling from trees, with near missing on people. Don't stay after a rain, it becomes a haven for mosquitoes. The uneven ground made for large puddles and mud everywhere. Their claim of a sandy beach is bull, it's a muddy swimming hole, the fishing is great.",
    " The owners are surly and rude. It was like being in a military camp. If there was different management/ owners, we might go back. These people act like they are doing you a favour. Very pricy accommodations. Not a walk to the beach but a drive. Wouldn't recommend it",
    "This park is a absolute JOKE!! Over priced, understaffed and a disease invested breeding ground for people or animals! should be shut down by the ministry of health!!! It used to be a fabulous place but they must of changed ownership because the place is a disgrace to the camping community! I have never seen a more unclean park in my life, and I have stayed in some bad parks! The bad part is, it has the potential to be a beautiful place to camp with the facilities already in place, but I guess the almighty dollar (which they charge a premium for everything), is more important to them. Take my advice as a seasoned veteran of camping and avoid this park at all cost!!!!",
    "A nice park, well situated with nice view of the St.john river, BUT if you have a dog , kids or like to sit outside and play cards in your screen tent to keep away from the bugs don't go here. Your kids will be screamed at every time they move or go on the grass, micro managed around the swimming pool or berated every time they be kids. We were treated rudely the whole time we spent there , which turned out to be one night although we had planned on several days Our friends who came the following morning with their dog were refused entry and told to go to a campsite across the river. Our elderly neighbours wanted to play cards in a sceen tent between their two trailer sites , but were told they could not role down the screens and at 10 oclock were told they had to turn out their lights and go inside.",
    "Go elsewhere!!!.Awful place! Full of transient people and drug dealers. Owner Minnie is one of the most unpleasant people I have ever met. You would be better staying in a Walmart parking lot",
    "Terrible place to go not pet friendly,some older man going around trying to touch the children,cheap,money hunbgry managers unreasonable ,the kids did not like the people at the canteen,pool was dirty things were broken,not a wel kept campground,spaces very small,no place to party",
    "So rude.Woman at front desk was rude rude rude. Campground was small, cramped, and dirty. Most importantly, staff was rude, loud, obnoxious, and quite frankly disgusting. Just keep driving, not worth it.",
    "Didnt like the service no privacy fishing sucked and they made me turn my little stereo off at like 10pm",
    "Never Again...I would not recommend the park to anyone. The management was not friendly nor helpful. The lake was nice except for the hundreds of dead catfish...would not go swimming. The water had a awful smell and is not drinkable. Other campers seemed friendly and helpful.",
    " I planned to spend 10 days but left after 3 days. The website advertised sandy beach. The beach was dirty , the water full of seaweed and dead animals rotting in the water. I would not let anyone swim in that water. The pool was cloudy and not safe for swimming. I contacted Castle Vacation Parks with my concerned and they ignored them. Warning- do not believe the website description.",
    "I found the management very rude and unprofessional.The water quality was horrible, both color and smell.Major upgrades are needed. But we did love the fact that you could go boating/fishing from the campground.Also made some very great friends while staying there.",
    "loved the location, didn't love the mean people running the park. water was discusting.",
